## Introduction
Taco CO's musical playlist generator helps the user search for music, create and organize searched songs into a playlist, that can then be exported. Our application it the first of it's kind to also feature TacoTV, which displays unique GIFs while the user listens to music!

## UI
The Taco's Co. Playlist Generator allows users to search for music by artist,
song name and album. From the search results, users are then able to preview a 30 second audio clip of each song and add the song to their playlist. Once a song is added the TacoTv entertainment will be replaced by their playlist. Once the desired playlist has been created, the user can then export their playlist to their clipboard. The user also has the option to review top tracks from three recommended playlists. Track information from these playlists are populated when the user clicks on a playlist in carousel.

 Our application utilizes the following technologies:
